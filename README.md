# A Repo for personal projects 

This is a repo for all the pieces of code I've written while learning chemical engineering.

Many of my python projects are quite old as I have switched to Julia. 

The only thing I haven't ported to Julia from python is my old and incomplete process simulator and my MESH distillation solver. 

Most of the work I've done recently has revolved around solving ODEs, PDEs in Julia as well as working ModelingToolkit.jl
