# A Repo for personal projects 

This is a repo for all the pieces of code I've written while learning chemical engineering.

Many of my python projects are quite old as I have switched to Julia.

Most of the work I've done recently has revolved around solving ODEs, PDEs in Julia as well as working modelingtoolkit.
